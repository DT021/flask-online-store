## Repository Structure :deciduous_tree:

 <img src="images/struct.png">

Based on the directories present

* Model directory contains all the database model class and methods associated
 
* Resource directory contains api resource classes 

* Schemas is for the marshmallow schemas 

* Split contains sample code which can help you understand the code base

* Static is the directory where user images are uploaded

* Templates conatins html templates


## DataBase Architecture :desktop_computer:
```sh

There are mainly four schemas 

* Users - which contains details about the users
* Store - which contains details about the store

## Functionalities present

1) flask_jwt_extended
  - [Read about it here](https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

  - flask jwt extended allows us to generate access and refresh tokens
  ```sh
        access_token = create_access_token(identity=user.id,fresh=True)
        refresh_token = create_refresh_token(user.id)

        return {
            "access_token": access_token,
            "refresh_token": refresh_token
        },200
   ```
    
  - For all post and put methods jwt token is required

  - Deletion requires a fresh jwt token so might prompt you to sign in again

2) flask marshmallow
  - [Read about it here](https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

  - flask marshmallow allows us to easily seralize and desarlize data 

  - Check marsh_app.py file under split directory which contains simple example of using flask marshmallow
  
   ```sh
        class RewardSchema(ma.SQLAlchemyAutoSchema):
            class Meta:
                model = Reward
                load_instance = True

        class MarshSchema(ma.SQLAlchemyAutoSchema):
            rewards = ma.Nested(RewardSchema,many=True)
            class Meta:
                model = Marsh
                load_instance = True

   ```
   
  - The example used above has been similarly implemented in the project

  - flask marshmallow latest version has syantax  different from previous versions 

  - marshamllow integrates well with SQLAlchemy 

3) flask mail 
  - [Read about it here](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/)

  - flask mail allows us to integrate mailing service with flask easily

  - Check mail.py file under split directory which contains simple example to use flask mail
  
  ```sh
        msg= Message("Confirm Email",recipients=[email])
        link = url_for("token_verify",token=tok,_external=True)
        msg.body = "Verify email address by clicking here {}".format(link)
        mail.send(msg)
  ```
  
  - This is used for user confirmation during signup
